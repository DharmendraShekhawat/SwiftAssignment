# Visitors Count Management API

Visitors Count API is a Java application built using Maven and the Spring Boot framework.

## Frameworks and Language Used

- Java: The primary programming language used for developing the application.
- Maven: A build automation tool and dependency management tool used for managing the project's dependencies and building the application.
- Spring Boot: A powerful and widely used framework for building Java-based enterprise applications. It provides features like inversion of control, dependency injection, and seamless integration with various other libraries.

### VisitorController

I have implemented controllers for visitor operations. The provided APIs include:
1. `GET /visitorCount : To get visitors count.
2. `GET /visit : To increase the count of unique visitor.


### Services

The services layer contains business logic for visitors count. It acts as an intermediary between the controllers and the repository, encapsulating complex functionalities.

### Repository

The repository layer is responsible for data access and manipulation. It communicates with the database and performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update) operations on the visitorDb.


# Database Structure Used
I have used MySql as Database.
